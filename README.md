# HR-ANALYSIS-DATA
Project Overview

This project analyzes workforce composition, compensation structure, and performance-driven rewards to uncover patterns affecting organizational equity and talent management.
The goal was to transform raw HR data into a decision-support dashboard that clearly answers:

Who makes up the workforce?

How is pay distributed across departments and salary bands?

Are compensation and bonuses aligned with performance?

Where do disparities exist that leadership must address?

Business Problem

Organizations often track headcount and payroll but lack visibility into how compensation, performance, and structure interact.
Without this clarity, it becomes difficult to:

Detect pay imbalance across roles or groups

Evaluate whether bonuses truly reward performance

Understand workforce cost drivers
Data Preparation

The dataset required extensive transformation before analysis:

Cleaned inconsistent salary and bonus fields

Standardized categorical variables (Department, Rating, Gender, Eligibility Status)

Created calculated fields such as:

Salary Bands for structured comparison

Total Pay (Salary + Bonus)

Bonus Eligibility Indicator

Performance-Based Aggregations

Built a custom Sort Column to ensure logical ordering of salary bands in visuals.

Plan fair and sustainable compensation strategies

This project bridges that gap by delivering a data-driven workforce intelligence solution.
