# HR-ANALYSIS-DATA
Project Overview

This project analyzes workforce composition, compensation structure, and performance-driven rewards to uncover patterns affecting organizational equity and talent management.
The goal was to transform raw HR data into a decision-support dashboard that clearly answers:

Who makes up the workforce?

How is pay distributed across departments and salary bands?

Are compensation and bonuses aligned with performance?

Where do disparities exist that leadership must address?

Business Problem

Organizations often track headcount and payroll but lack visibility into how compensation, performance, and structure interact.
Without this clarity, it becomes difficult to:

Detect pay imbalance across roles or groups

Evaluate whether bonuses truly reward performance

Understand workforce cost drivers
Data Preparation

The dataset required extensive transformation before analysis:

Cleaned inconsistent salary and bonus fields

Standardized categorical variables (Department, Rating, Gender, Eligibility Status)

Created calculated fields such as:

Salary Bands for structured comparison

Total Pay (Salary + Bonus)

Bonus Eligibility Indicator

Performance-Based Aggregations

Built a custom Sort Column to ensure logical ordering of salary bands in visuals.

Plan fair and sustainable compensation strategies

This project bridges that gap by delivering a data-driven workforce intelligence solution.

Analytical Approach

The analysis emphasized comparative metrics rather than raw totals:

Averages to measure fairness and consistency

Distributions to identify concentration and imbalance

Segmentation (Bands & Ratings) to reveal structural patterns

Calculated Measures to evaluate compensation logic rather than just payroll volume

This ensures leadership decisions are based on quality of pay structure, not just spend.



Key Insights
1. The Company Operates a Moderate Pay Structure

The average salary is around ₦74K, showing the organization controls costs and focuses on maintaining a stable workforce rather than paying premium salaries.

2. Many Employees Are Clustered in Lower Salary Bands

Most staff earn below ₦90K, meaning there is a wide base of mid-level earners and fewer employees in higher-paying roles.

Meaning: Growth opportunities into higher pay levels may be limited.

3. The Gender Pay Gap Is Small but Linked to Position Levels

The pay gap (~3.5%) is not caused by unequal pay for the same job.
Instead, more men are found in higher salary bands.

Meaning: The issue is career progression, not pay discrimination.

4. Bonuses Are Driven More by Departments Than Performance

Some departments (like Training and Engineering) receive more bonuses even though overall performance ratings are similar.

Meaning: Bonuses may not be strongly tied to actual performance outcomes.

5. Salaries Are Similar Across Locations

Pay levels remain almost the same in different cities, showing a centralized pay system.

Meaning: The company values consistency but may not account for local cost differences.

6. Bonuses Make Up a Small Part of Total Pay

Bonus payouts are small compared to total salaries, so they may not strongly motivate performance.

7. Workforce Gender Balance Is Strong

Male and female representation is nearly equal, which shows inclusive hiring practices.

Meaning: The focus should now be on equal advancement into higher roles.

Recommendations
1. Create Clear Promotion Paths

Define what employees must achieve to move into higher salary bands (skills, years of service, performance).

2. Monitor Career Progression Across Genders

Track promotions to ensure equal access to senior and higher-paying roles.

3. Link Bonuses More Directly to Performance

Use measurable performance metrics to decide bonus payouts rather than relying on department patterns.

4. Review Pay Structure by Location

Consider small adjustments based on regional realities to stay competitive.

5. Decide the Purpose of Bonuses

Either increase bonuses to truly drive performance or position them clearly as recognition rewards.

Conclusion

The organization has a balanced workforce and good cost control, but it can improve how employees grow, earn, and get rewarded.
Better alignment between performance, progression, and compensation will strengthen motivation and long-term workforce development.
